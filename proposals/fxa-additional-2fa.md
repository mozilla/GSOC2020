# Integrate additional options for 2FA on Firefox Account

**Mentor:** Vijay Budhram

**Email:** vbudhram@mozilla.com

## Project Description

To better help protect Firefox Account (FxA) users, we want to integrate an additional 2FA method.
Currently, FxA only supports one 2FA method via an [OTP code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password).
If a user loses access to the associated authenication device, possibly through
getting a new phone, they could get locked out of their account.

Having an additional option for 2FA could allow our users to regain access to their account
as well as provide more security.

## Skills Required

Applicants needs:

* Git, Github
* NodeJS, Javascript, CSS, HTML
* MySQL
* Good communication

## Project Details

The new 2FA method is still under discussion however this project would include addin database tables, webservices and UX to support the
new 2FA method.
