## Project Details

Common Voice is a crowdsourcing platform for collecting and aggregating voluntary voice clips. The team frequently attends conferences, events, and community gatherings to demo the project and to encourage participation. Right now the website is neither optimized for a tablet view, nor does it have a demo-friendly workflow.

Sample designs for a Kiosk mode can be [seen on Figma (not finalized)](https://www.figma.com/file/noKMY6aOXz9vwxlkO0XZEl/kiosk-mode-demo-tablet?node-id=0%3A1). The actual implementation details will be determined in collaboration between the student and the mentor (one possibility includes building a PWA).

Here is a rough expected timeline for 12 weeks of work:

* ~1 week: project setup, learning the codebase, meeting the team
* ~2 weeks: scoping out project, researching and determining best approach
* ~2 weeks: working with UX leads to finalize desings
* ~4 weeks: active development based on finalized designs
* ~2 weeks: QA and refinement
* ~1 week: documentation, product demo, retrospective
