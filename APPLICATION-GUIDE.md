# Applying to work with Mozilla in GSOC 2020

This document is a rough guide to what we are looking for in a GSOC
application, and in the applicant. It should not be interpreted as a
checklist, but it does list both what we would like to learn about an
applicant and pitfalls to avoid in the application process.

Mozilla does not assign "pre-work" to prospective applicants; while
it might be helpful for us in assessing applicants' abilities - and we
always want to be open to new contributors - we also don't want to treat
GSOC acceptance as a prize you might win if you volunteer hard enough.
You are always welcome to download our code and learn about our teams,
produtrs and build processes but as a participant the best approach is
to use what you learn to inform an excellent GSOC proposal, not to think
that you need to rack up "points" in order to be considered.

# What we would like to see

Perhaps obviously, we need a few specifics: Your name, email, telephone
number or other contact method, your country of residence, timezone and
primary language. We'd like to know about your programming experience,
as well; this can be work or internship experience, other open source
projects you've contributed to, and what you've worked on in school.
What you have *done* and what you have *learned* are both valuable here.

Beyond that, the questions we would like to see answered in your
application include:

* What project are you applying for?  
* Do you understand the requirements for it, and - 
* Are your skills and experience a good fit for this
project and it's goals? In short, why you, and why us?

The best applications we receive tend to answer these questions with
project diagrams and work schedules, breaking down projects into their
deliverable components and describing the timelines on which these
components might be shipped.

This isn't necessarily the schedule we'd hold a successful applicant to,
but we *need to see something realistic* here. Writing software is hard
and scheduling software is harder, and our priority in this is to set
up these projects and the people participating in them for a successful
summer.

Strong applications also note that you've made other choices outside
GSoC that are roughly aligned, in some way, with the project itself.
A hypothetical application to work on audio compression algorithms from
somebody who has previously worked on music applications, for example, 
might be better-received than one from somebody whose primary career
focus has been front-end web development or mobile applications.

Finally, do you have any other commitments during the GSoC period, and how will
they affect your work? These aren't normally deal-breakers; in the past
we've accomodated people who've needed to care for elderly relatives on
a certain schedule, and in one case a student needed to be away from their
work for a week in order to get married. We can be reasonably accomodating
on this front, we simply prefer not to be surprised.

# Errors to avoid

Every year we need to immediately discard an upsetting number of applications
for avoidable reasons. Some of these may seem obvious, but they keep 
coming back, so you should be aware of them.

* Failing to apply for a specific project. A surprising number of people
apply for... nothing? I'm not sure how this happens, but I suppose in
some sense those applications are all successful; in applying for nothing,
they successfully receive nothing. If this is not your preferred outcome,
please avoid this oversight.

* Cut-and-paste errors, including irrelevant and superfluous information. If
you've included the fact that you're licensed to operate a forklift in your
application, we are likely to think that you haven't given this the thought
it probably requires. If you've overlooked formatting errors or template residue
in your application, what does that say about your code?

* Suggest that hard work and enthuisasm can overcome a complete absence of 
demonstrated ability or relevant experience. While you may be willing to work
hard, people with experience work hard too, so this argument does not hold a 
lot of water. 

* Finally, please double check that your application is *actually finished*.
We've had a number of students with "FIXME" or "TODO" in their final applications,
which we have to disqualify, however good the part that's already done looks.


Again, thank you for your interest in Mozilla and the Google Summer of Code. We
look forward to seeing your applications, and hope that if you've got questions
that you can find us on Matrix.
